# Mammas_Kitchen

Developed Mamma's Kitchen, a web-based platform using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for the frontend, with PHP for the backend, and phpMyAdmin for database management. This project focuses on women empowerment by enabling housewives and women entrepreneurs to register and offer tiffin services to college students and bachelors seeking hygienic home-cooked meals.

The platform includes two modules: Admin and Customer. The Admin module allows women to register as cooks, create profiles, design and update weekly food timetables, manage order statuses, generate reports, and handle customer payments. The Customer module enables users to register, view food timetables, place orders, opt for monthly subscriptions, make payments via UPI, and track delivery status. All modules are designed with robust security and authentication to protect user data, ensuring a secure and efficient food delivery service
